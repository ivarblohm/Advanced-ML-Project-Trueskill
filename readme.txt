 The code is set up in a way that you can run everything sequentially. You can press run all, let it run for a couple of minutes and then observe the resulting code for all parts.

Observe that Q9 is presented at the bottom of the notebook. It made sense to present Q6,7,10,11 in a row since they (in this case) reuse so much code and will present the same plots.
